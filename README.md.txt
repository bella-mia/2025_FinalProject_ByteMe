# 🎓 Behavioral Data Science II – Final Project: Byte Me

Welcome to **Byte Me** – a little salty, a little nerdy, but always efficient with our code. This is our final project for Behavioral Data Science II at UT Austin.

## 🧠 Abstract

We’re analyzing a dataset of 1,000+ synthetic resumes to figure out what really influences hiring decisions. By identifying key predictors of recruiter outcomes (like skills, experience, or AI scores), we’ll train machine learning models to predict hiring success. We’re also diving into how AI aligns—or doesn’t—with human judgment. Spoiler alert: it might not always agree. 👀

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes:
- 1,000+ synthetic resume profiles  
- Features such as:  
  - Education  
  - Skills  
  - Certifications  
  - Experience  
  - Project Count  
  - AI Screening Score  
  - Recruiter Decision  

📁 **Dataset URL**: AI-Powered Resume Screening Dataset (2025)

## ❓ Research Questions & Hypotheses

**RQ1**: What are the top 2 resume features that influence recruiter hiring decisions?  
> **H1**: Skills and experience will be the strongest predictors.

**RQ2**: Does the AI score align with recruiter decisions?  
> **H2**: We expect alignment in more than half of the cases.

**RQ3**: Are there mismatches between AI and recruiter decisions that suggest potential bias?  
> **H3**: AI may favor quantitative metrics like experience or project count over qualitative traits.

## 🧪 Methods & Analysis

**Analytical Plan:**
- Descriptive statistics & data cleaning
- Pair plots to visualize correlations
- Dimensionality reduction using PCA
- Predictive modeling:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Naive Bayes  
- Evaluation:
  - Confusion matrix (AI vs recruiter)
  - False positives/negatives analysis
- Statistical Testing:
  - T-test / ANOVA for hired vs rejected
  - Chi-square tests for categorical variables
